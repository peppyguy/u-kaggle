Of course, this data is from one local in Scotland, so clearly cannot truly be generalized, but still fun to look at nonetheless. My assumption looking at this data is that we tend to drink more coffee on weekdays to power us through the work day.\n\nThis is a work in progress!

More exploration is needed; there are obvious potentially-confounding variables still at play. For example, Edinburgh is quite tourism-heavy, so there could simply be a much larger number of patrons on the weekend. Viewing the data normalizing by total number of transactions may be the logical next step. \n\n## Next Steps\n\nMore visualizations to come!
