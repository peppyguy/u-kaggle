Here, we will take a finer scale to get the visualization right. I decided to look at the rolling sum of crimes of the past year. The idea is, for each day, we calculate the sum of crimes of the past year. If this rolling sum is decreasing, then we know for sure that crime rates have been decreasing during that year.
