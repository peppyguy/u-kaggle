That's no news, everyone knows that by now. Every industry is being affected by AI, AI/ML startups are booming ... No doubt, now sounds like the perfect time to be a data scientist !  \nThat being said, two industries stand out for me when it comes to applying machine learning : **Healthcare and Economic Development**. Not that other applications aren't useful or interesting but those two are, in my opinion, showing how we can really use technology to make the world a better place. Some impressive projects on those fields are being conducted right now by several teams; *Stanford* has an ongoing project about predicting poverty rates with satellite imagery, how impressive is that ?!\n\nHere in Kaggle, we already have experience with the first one (healthcare), for example, every year there's the *Data Science Bowl* challenge where competitors do their very best to achieve something unprecedented, in 2017, the competition's goal was to **improve cancer screening care and prevention**.  \nI was very excited and pleased when I got the email informing me about the Kiva Crowdfunding challenge and it's nice to know that this is only the beggining, with many more other competitions to come in the Data Science for Good program.\n\nBeing myself very interested in those issues and taking courses such as *Microeconomics* and *Data Analysis for Social Scientists* (If interested, you can find both courses [here](https://micromasters.mit.edu/dedp/), excellent content proposed by MIT and Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab), I decided to publish a notebook in this challenge and take the opportunity to use everything I've learned so far.     \n**Through this notebook**, I hope that not only will you learn some Data Analysis / Machine Learning stuff, but also (and maybe mostly) learn a lot about economics (I'll do my best), learn about poverty challenges in the countries where Kiva is heavily involved, learn about how you can collect data that's useful in those problems and hopefully inspire you to apply your data science skills to build a better living place in the future !\n\n**P.S : This will be a work in progress for at least a month. I will constantly try to improve the content, add new stuff and make use of any interesting new dataset that gets published for this competition.**\n\nEnjoy !"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"83e2144b818637f5bbebd9595661e0efbc62c313","_cell_guid":"1869acd9-5bdc-4776-bcc8-80f20b9b88f8"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Table of contents\n***\n\n* [About Kiva and the challenge](#introduction)\n\n* [1.

When you go to kiva.org, you can choose a theme (Refugees, Shelter, Health ...) or a country and you'll get a list of all the loans you can fund with a description of the borrower, his needs and the time he'll need for repayment. So far, Kiva has funded more than 1 billion dollars to 2 million borrowers and is considered a major actor in the fight against poverty, especially in many African countries.\n\nIn this challenge, the ultimate goal is to obtain as precise informations as possible about the poverty level of each borrower / region because that would help setting investment priorities. Kagglers are invited to use Kiva's data as well as any external public datasets to build their poverty estimation model.  \nAs for Kiva's data, here's what we've got : \n* **kiva_loans** : That's the dataset that contains most of the informations about the loans (id of borrower, amount of loan, time of repayment, reason for borrowing ...)\n* **kiva_mpi_region_locations** : This dataset contains the MPI of many regions (subnational) in the world.\n* **loan_theme_ids** : This dataset has the same unique_id as the kiva_loans (id of loan) and contains information about the theme of the loan.\n* **loan_themes_by_region** : This dataset contains specific informations about geolocation of the loans.\n\nThis notebook will be divided into two parts : \n1. First I will conduct an EDA using mainly the 4 datasets provided by Kiva. \n2. After that, I'll try to use the informations I got from the EDA and external public datasets to build a model for poverty level estimation."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_kg_hide-output":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":false,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport missingno as msno\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nimport seaborn as sns\nplt.style.use('seaborn-darkgrid')\npalette = plt.get_cmap('Set1')\n\nimport plotly.offline as py\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.tools as tls\nimport plotly.figure_factory as ff\n\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nimport os\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"0132e4465cfd3dbb588fcaa818d5be53518a8ccd","_cell_guid":"7f55911f-c6f6-4e45-9a34-2e14db8ee77c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.

The bank defines extreme poverty as living on less than US\\$1.90 per day (PPP), and moderate poverty as less than \\$3.10 a day.  \nP.S: In this part, we'll say (PPP) a lot. It refers to Purchasing Power Parity. I have a notebook that is entirely dedicated to PPP and if interested and want to know more about how it works, you can check it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mhajabri/salary-and-purchasing-power-parity).  \nOver the past half century, significant improvements have been made and still, extreme poverty remains widespread in the developing countries. Indeed, an estimated **1.374 billion people live on less than  1.25 \\$ per day** (at 2005 U.S. PPP) and around **2.6 billion (which is basically 40% of the worlds's population !!) live on less than \\$ 2 per day**. Those impoverished people suffer from : undernutrition / poor health, live in environmentally degraded areas, have little literacy ...\n\nAs you can see, poverty seems to be defined exactly by the way it's actually measured, but what's wrong with that definition ? **In developing countries, many of the poor work in the informal sector and lack verifiable income records => income data isn't reliable**. Suppose you're the government and you have a specific program that benefits the poorest or you're Kiva and you want to know who's in the most critical condition, then relying on income based poverty measures in developing countries will be misleading and using unreliable information to identify eligible households can result in funds being diverted to richer households and leave fewer resources for the programâ€™s intended beneficiaries. We need another way of measuring poverty.
