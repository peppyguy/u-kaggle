Not only students, but also businesses take advantage of it, by using it as a platform for hiring students. I remember giving so many hackerrank tests during my placements. It has many tracks like **Linux Shell Scripting, SQL, Programming Language Practise Problems, and also ML/AI Problems**(can be a competiton to Kaggle..:p). This year HackerRank conducted a survey for its users,collecting data like languages used by them, their source of study, their domain of study,etc. I too had participated in this survey, and it would be a fun analysing this dataset, and maybe I will be able to find my own response(seems impossible..xd).\n\nA similar dataset was released by Kaggle last year, which had responses by Kaggle Users regarding their opinions on Data Science and Machine Learning.My notebook on the Kaggle ML Dataset is **[linked here](https://www.kaggle.com/ash316/novice-to-grandmaster)**. I will try to compare results based on some common parameters between both these datasets.So lets start our analysis.\n\n#### Focus of the Notebook\n\nAs the dataset aims to find **Women's involvement in tech, opinions of students and professionals**, this notebook will also revolve around the same topic. We will try to find out how much are women involved in tech and some other insights with our exploration.\n\nIf u like this notebook, **Do Upvote**"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"01d07b9f660c1f46aa46829d546a1e72692bc2bf","_cell_guid":"090368b3-ef4c-4414-b231-b11f1c638578","trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nplt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\nimport plotly\nimport plotly.offline as py\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\nimport plotly.tools as tls\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.tools as tls","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"0cee6b9187751247ea1e6a7c1163618327ec008d","_cell_guid":"640bbcdc-2150-4237-94af-2e451d138519","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df=pd.read_csv('../input/HackerRank-Developer-Survey-2018-Values.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"62be546501f0404828d9757e0a189909eba1bd7b","_cell_guid":"4a5d4171-96f1-458a-bed3-57b67f87aeb0"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Checking Null Values"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"fdeb8200ed28cd11a2b7fd9abb59bc8b277c92d1","_cell_guid":"a5c921c9-4199-425a-bd57-7941e56b6076","trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import missingno as msno\nmsno.matrix(df)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"cab9d28ed02689eea947c7be585ef7b219a976f3","_cell_guid":"1853e89c-be01-4ff5-8ede-c7ecf2107be1"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"So the above diagram shows the amount of missing data in the dataset.

It was also good to see that many people had started coding in an early stage i.e between **(11-20)** years.\n - Majority of the respondents are from the CS background.\n - **Specific to Women**:\n  - Women over the age of 35 are not much into tech, which means that about 10-15 years back not many women were getting into the tech industry. However it is good to see that many young laldies are now getting into tech world, and many of them have started coding at an early age. Thus the future will see a rise in female coders/programmers.\n  - About **50-60%** of the total women belong to the CS background, which again is a positive trait for women in tech.\n  - About **50%** of the total working women are working in the tech industry, with a majority of them being **Software Engineer and Full-Stack Developers**. However the number of women in **Data Science is very less.** However this condition may change in the near future as many women are looking to learn ML/AI in the future.\n  - Not many women are at a Senior Position, majority of them being **Level 1 developers.**\n\n- **Recruiment Point of View:**\n - **Java, JavaScript , AngularJs, Python and SQL** are some of the most common and important technological skills that recruiters search for.\n - Apart from programming languages, **Problem Solving** skills is the most important skill that a candidate should have.\n - **Work Experience and Projects** are also very important things that recruiters look for.\n \n- **C,C++ and Java** are the most familiar languages to developers, among both **students and professionals**. However many students and professionals, who are not familiar with these languages, are still not willing to learn them as compared to other languages like **Python, Scala and Go**. The **popularity for dynamic and functional programming languages is on a rise**, and the demand for such talent will surely grow in the future. These languages are famous among both students and working professionals.\n- **Python is the most loved and least hated** language. This makes Python as a must for almost any person belonging to the technical domain.\n- **Security, AI/ML/Data Science and Cloud  Computing** are some very prominent domains  the future.\n\n## **Something For HackerRank p**:\n - HackerRank has very positive reviews and ratings from its users. However not many recruiters use HackerRank for their assessment of new candidates. Thus HackerRank must do something so that their amazing platform is widely used by managers for recruitment purpose."},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"3a6a68403abd10eed2b2a3d84fc1f6fe144fddb4","_cell_guid":"7be11fe2-9ad6-474b-b2f0-680ad8e44b7b"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Thanks a lot for having a look at this notebook.
