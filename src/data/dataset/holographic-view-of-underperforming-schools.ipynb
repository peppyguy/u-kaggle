This has resulted in lack of diversity in the students that attend the specialized high schools which offer admissions based on the results of SHSAT.\nThis is a long standing problem in the elite high schools of the city. ([Report](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/08/nyregion/08specialized.html) highlighting the same issue from over a decade ago).\n\n### Notable facts\nSome facts about SHSAT which will be explain the relevance of the problem and would be helpful in understanding the observations posted below:\n* Specialized High Schools Admissions Test is the admissions criterion for eight of the nine specialized high schools\n* Students of class 8 and 9 are eligible to appear in the test. The only way to register for the SHSAT is through your middle school guidance counselor. \n* There are two SHSAT sections: English Language Arts (ELA) and Math\n* The three highest-status schools—Stuyvesant, Bronx Science, and Brooklyn Tech—have black and Latino student populations of 4, 9, and 13 percent, respectively, far below the 70 percent in public schools citywide.\n\n### Our analysis/ Proposed solution metrics\nWe analyse the cause for the low percentage of black/ hispanic students appearing for and clearing the test. Based on this analysis, we also suggest solutions which can help bring more diversity into these specialized high schools. We attempt to: <br>\n a) Identify schools with students who are eligible for SHSAT <br>\n b) Identify possible reasons for underperformance/ non appearance in SHSAT <br>\n c) Analyse factors like Economic need index, crime rate, low attendance, etc. for low performing schools <br/>\n d) Pinpoint the key improvements needed in those schools <br>\n e) Explain the rational/ statistics behind each of the decisions <br>\n f) Identify ideal locations for resource centers/ learning centers which could serve multiple schools concurrently by being easily reachable from those\n \n \n### References\n[This article](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/06/new-york-high-schools-stuyvesant-brooklyn-bronx/562772/) is a very good read for people who wish to understand the problem in more detail and how it was originated. <br/>\n[Eight elite high schools admissions details](https://nypost.com/2015/09/27/the-elite-eight-here-are-the-top-schools-in-nyc/) <br/>\n[Older report](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/08/nyregion/08specialized.html) highlighting the same issue <br/>\n\n\n![kaggle_homepage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InFoCusp/kaggle_images/master/kaggle_homepage.png)\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"79b6e6b95b54cc60e9cb0b32a6919070399e1207"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### About the dataset\n2 files have been provided\n1. <b> 2016 School Explorer.csv </b> : Contains 1272 rows, each describing a separate school in terms of its 161 features which include\n    * Locality information (Lat/ Long/ ZIP/ Address/ City (45 unique cities) / District (32)/ SED code (unique to school) )\n    * Students of each ethnicity registered in ELA/ Maths in different grades\n    * School evaluation metrics\n    * ELL(English Language Learners) information\n    * Economin Need Index \n    * Attendance Information\n            \n2. <b> D5 SHSAT Registrations and Testers.csv </b> : Contains information on the students of 30 schools of district 5 who registered for/ actually appeared for SHSAT, along with the breakdown by ethnicity.\n "},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"51849d2b689c85e66cd3dcb788199aec6231f2d0"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### First things first \n\nThe eligibility criterion for SHSAT is : Grade 8/9 students\n* Of the total 1272 schools, only 619 schools have classes beyond grade 5.
