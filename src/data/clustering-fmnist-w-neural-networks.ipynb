Self-organizing maps differ from other artificial neural networks as they apply competitive learning as opposed to error-correction learning (such as backpropagation with gradient descent), and in the sense that they use a neighborhood function to preserve the topological properties of the input space.\n<img src=\"http://www.pitt.edu/~is2470pb/Spring05/FinalProjects/Group1a/tutorial/kohonen1.gif\">\nThis makes SOMs useful for visualization by creating low-dimensional views of high-dimensional data, akin to multidimensional scaling. The artificial neural network introduced by the Finnish professor Teuvo Kohonen in the 1980s is sometimes called a Kohonen map or network. The Kohonen net is a computationally convenient abstraction building on biological models of neural systems from the 1970s and morphogenesis models dating back to Alan Turing in the 1950s.\n<img src=\"https://www.nnwj.de/uploads/pics/1_2-kohonon-feature-map.gif\">\nWhile it is typical to consider this type of network structure as related to feedforward networks where the nodes are visualized as being attached, this type of architecture is fundamentally different in arrangement and motivation. It has been shown that while self-organizing maps with a small number of nodes behave in a way that is similar to K-means, larger self-organizing maps rearrange data in a way that is fundamentally topological in character.\n\nSource: [Wikipedia](http://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_map)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c31a7c39f25c09e72ff10c3630365ec7c73e141b"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Things we can do with Self Organizing Maps\n* Visualizing high dimensional data into a low dimensional view which is usually 2D - In this case we have 784 columns because the Fashion MNIST dataset has images of dimensions 28x28 \n* Clustering - According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_map): It has been shown that while self-organizing maps with a small number of nodes behave in a way that is similar to K-means, larger self-organizing maps rearrange data in a way that is fundamentally topological in character.\n* Anomaly detection - We identify entities whose topological distance to its topological neighbors is significantly higher than all its topological neighbors amongst themselves as anomalies\n* Non-linear DImensionality Reduction - For visualization, we convert high-dimensional data into low-dimensional data"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"b9e6f92b8a0a7de60cbad39da167a60770b2412d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# About the dataset: Fashion MNIST\n## Context\nFashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Zalando intends Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.\n\nThe original MNIST dataset contains a lot of handwritten digits. Members of the AI/ML/Data Science community love this dataset and use it as a benchmark to validate their algorithms. In fact, MNIST is often the first dataset researchers try. \"If it doesn't work on MNIST, it won't work at all\", they said. \"Well, if it does work on MNIST, it may still fail on others.\" Zalando seeks to replace the original MNIST dataset.\n\n## Content\nEach image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total. Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255. The training and test data sets have 785 columns. The first column consists of the class labels (see above), and represents the article of clothing. The rest of the columns contain the pixel-values of the associated image. To locate a pixel on the image, suppose that we have decomposed x as x = i * 28 + j, where i and j are integers between 0 and 27. The pixel is located on row i and column j of a 28 x 28 matrix. For example, pixel31 indicates the pixel that is in the fourth column from the left, and the second row from the top, as in the ascii-diagram below. \n\n## Labels\nLabels\nEach training and test example is assigned to one of the following labels:\n* 0 T-shirt/top\n* 1 Trouser\n* 2 Pullover\n* 3 Dress\n* 4 Coat\n* 5 Sandal\n* 6 Shirt\n* 7 Sneaker\n* 8 Bag\n* 9 Ankle boot \n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Loading libraries\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom minisom import MiniSom\nfrom hyperopt import fmin, hp, tpe, Trials, STATUS_OK\nimport concurrent.futures\nimport time\nfrom pylab import bone, pcolor, colorbar, plot, show, rcParams, savefig\nimport os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Loading training and test set\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/fashion-mnist_train.csv')\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/fashion-mnist_test.csv')\ntrain.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"090cc984845cfb615dbce16cbce70dc78243ef64"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Combining training and test set to get over 70k samples\nnew_train = train.drop(columns=['label'])\nnew_test = test.drop(columns=['label'])\nsom_data = pd.concat([new_train, new_test], ignore_index=True).values\nlabels = pd.concat([train['label'], test['label']], ignore_index=True).values","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6191482a0c1d7746e304b7484b6beef2d2f3adec"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Some sample images"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"8acc305edb6840fd8adb5b7641fcaf91d38bf5bb"},"cell_type":"code","source":"f, ax = plt.subplots(1,5)\nf.set_size_inches(80, 40)\nfor i in range(5):\n    ax[i].imshow(som_data[i].reshape(28, 28))\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8bd2a96c1e472b11d9b091ca21b1217f585d3435"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Minisom: A minimalistic implementation of Self Organizing Maps\nMiniSom is a minimalistic and Numpy based implementation of the Self Organizing Maps (SOM).
