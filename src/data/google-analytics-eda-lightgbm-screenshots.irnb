Hopefully, the outcome will be more actionable operational changes and a better use of marketing budgets for those companies who choose to use data analysis on top of GA data. For each fullVisitorId in the test set, you must predict the natural log of their total revenue. Submissions are scored on the root mean squared error (RMSE).\n\nThis kernel contains an **EDA**, a **Baseline LightGBM model**, and also **Screenshots of the app**. Since I am familiar with Google Analytics and also have the Google Mechandising store setup as a property in my personal environment, I though it would be good to start with some screen shots of the actual application. In the comments, the question was raised \"how I did this\". Well, actually this is pretty easy to setup, and you can find out how to do that through this link: [Learn by experimenting with data from the Google Merchandise Store.](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6367342?hl=en). However, once I really got started with the EDA, I increasingly found the large screenshots to become a bit distracting and I decided to separate these from the EDA and move them to an Appendix. To go straight to the screenshots: [Appendix: Screenshots](#Appendix:-Screenshots-of-the-app).\n\n# Table of contents\n\n* [1. Loading libraries and data](#1.-Loading-libraries-and-data)\n\n* [2.

However, there was an interesting finding in this discussion topic: [Finding - Pageviews/Hits ratio <0.4 guarantees no revenue](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ga-customer-revenue-prediction/discussion/66774). I was pointed to another definition:\n\n>Hit: An interaction that results in data being sent to Analytics. Common hit types include page tracking hits, event tracking hits, and ecommerce hits. Each time the tracking code is triggered by a userâ€™s behavior (for example, user loads a page on a website or a screen in a mobile app), Analytics records that activity. Each interaction is packaged into a hit and sent to Googleâ€™s servers. Examples of hit types include: page tracking hits, event tracking hits, ecommerce tracking hits, social interaction hits.\n\nThis made me believe that I should look at hits after all. The graph below shows a pattern that is very similar to the one of pageviews (no transactions for very few hits/pages, a correlation from x to y, and flat after that).
