One option would be to hand engineer features - for examples the mean of all pixels is probably a good feature to have. Other worthwhile features would be the slant, and the vertical or horizontal symmetry. \n\nBut we want do to machine learning not hand-craft features because we're lazy and machines tend to better capture important features in messy datasets. There are many ways to try to reduce the dimensionality - hereI am going to use an autoencoder. I like autoencoders because they have a nice intuitive appeal and you can train them relatively fast. \n\nAn **autoencoder ** is a feed- forward neural network who tries to learn a lower dimensional representation of our data. It does that by decreasing the number of layers in the middle of the network and then increasing it back to the dimension of the original image. \n\nSince the autoencoder is forced to reconstruct the images from a smaller representation it discards any variation that it doesn't find useful. Here is a great description form the [Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/autoencoders.html) book:\n\n\"The important principle is that the autoencoder can aﬀord to represent only the variations that are needed to reconstruct training examples. If the data generating distribution concentrates near a low-dimensional manifold, this yields representations that implicitly capture a local coordinate system for this manifold: only the variations tangent to the manifold around x need to correspond to changes in h=f(x).\""},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"80f17775-979d-3830-220d-7550d9058506","_uuid":"b2bec03fe26b9cd5182e29aa330ff07122883c69"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's build an autoencoder in keras - It will have 3 hidden layers with 64, 2, and 64 units respectively.
